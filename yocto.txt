add
S = ${WORKDIR}/git

List of variables (bindir, ...) can be found in conf/bitbake.conf

git default branch = master, when yocto fetch git source.
specify it by
SRC_URI = "git://<repo.git>;branch=branchname;protocol=https"
#latest revision
SRCRCV = "${AUTOREV}

# Fetch from local repository
SRC_URI = "git://<git-localpath>;protocol=file"

# Fetch from private repo
SRC_URI = "git://git@github.com/your_repo.git;protocol=ssh"
To use SSH, you must generate an SSH keypair on your computer and add the public key to your GitHub account

# Fetch by tag, don't use SRCREV
SRC_URI = "git://<repo.git>;branch=branchname;protocol=https;tag=rev-1.0"

# Patch source
SRC_URI = "git...  \
      file://0001-mypatch.patch \
"

# Create a patch 
=> After git commit
git show HEAD > my-patch.patch
git format-patch -1
